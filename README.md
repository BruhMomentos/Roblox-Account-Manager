# Roblox Account Manager
Application that allows you to add multiple accounts into one application allowing you to easily play on alt accounts without having to change accounts

Useful for games that require grinding off other players, or storage accounts that hold in game items or currency, or just to have multiple accounts that you can easily find and use.

You are welcome to edit the code and create pull requests if it'll benefit this project.
